This is a project for the WPI Frontiers Computer Science program.
It incorporates HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL programming.
The collection of languages makes up a website that runs the snake game where users operate a snake to collect apples and earn points.
The index.html page forces users to sign in with a username before continuing to the game for tracking purposes.
The username is recorded and after each attempt at the game their username and score is sent the the SQL server.
The SQL server also sends back the high score information to the index.html page and more information to the Top Scores page.
HTML and CSS are used to create the non-game portion of the website.
JS is used to operate the game and keep track of points.
PHP calls SQL commands to access the SQL server for score entries and to display score information on the site.
